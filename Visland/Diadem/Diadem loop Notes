the loop was created using pandora's auto interact with gathering nodes option as well as gatheringbuddy reborn to do a collection list
order the GB list in priority making sure theres no items of the oposite class
also avoid grade 4 in a main list as GBR has nodes for them it will try to path too - a fallback list works fine
if you want to use the cannon just pause visland while its gathering from a node

may still have a few spots that ocasionally hiccup and miss a node if the game/connection/etc lags.

this was created for getting the mats to do the crafting achievements without getting a massive amount of excess of the more common/less used ones
